# 🚗✨ ANPR and ATCC for Smart Traffic Management

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent traffic management system utilizing **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** and **Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC)**. By leveraging Deep Learning and Object Detection techniques, the system automates traffic monitoring and control in smart city environments.

## Key Features
- 📋 **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**
- 📋 License Plate Anotation.
- 📋 Extracting the License plate Number using OCR.
- 🚥 **Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC)**
- 📋 Vegicle Classification
- 📉 **Data interpolation for accurate tracking**
- 🎥 **Visualization capabilities**

### 🎬 Results
You can find the result video at `output_video/` directory

## 🚀 Workflow
1. 🏎️ **Execute `main.py`**  
   Perform initial vehicle detection and generate a CSV file in the `output/` directory.

2. 📈 **Run `add_missing_data.py`**  
   Perform data interpolation and generate an enhanced CSV file in the `output/` directory.

3. 🎥 **Run `visualize.py`**  
   Create a visualization video using interpolated data, saved in the `output_video/` directory.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AanchalSati/ANPR_ATCC_Smart_Traffic_Management.git
   cd anpr-atcc-traffic-management
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables:
Create a copy of .env.example (if provided) and rename it to .env.
Update the necessary secret keys and configurations.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project
1. Replace the path to your input video and your desired output directory.

2. Run the main detection:
   ```bash 
   python main.py
   ```
3. Perform data interpolation:
   ```bash
   python add_missing_data.py
   ```
4. Generate visualization:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```
